BACKING UP DATA
===============

If you need to backup your data or move it from one machine to another
you need to take a copy of the profile folder. This is located in:

    %APPDATA%\Thunderbird (Windows)
    ~/.thunderbird (Linux)
    ~/Library/Application Support/Thunderbird (Mac OS X)

It is highly recommended that you back up your profile folder and store it in a safe location whenever you create a new notebook unless you setup your own location of the new notebook. Without a backup, there is no way to recover your data if they are lost!
